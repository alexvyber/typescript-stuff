# Experiment: Import from JavaScript file, when .ts file also exists

## Example

This example demonstrates what happens if you try to import from a JavaScript file, 
with `allowJs` enabled, but there is a TypeScript file of the same name.

Based on what you've learned from the other examples, take a guess at what will happen,
then run `npm run build` to find out.
